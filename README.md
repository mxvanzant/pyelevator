# pyelevator
A Python controlled elevator code exercise.

This code exercise contains a bit of Python code to control a virtual elevator.

    (See problem_to_solve.pdf for details.)

    Just extract and run from a command line:

        ./elevator.py test_input a

            and also

        ./elevator.py test_input b

Two different algorithms ("a" and "b") are implemented.
